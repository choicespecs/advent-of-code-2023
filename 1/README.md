## Day 1 Notes

Looking for first and last digits in a string meaning we can utilize a stack.

- First value is always first digit in our 2 digit number
- Last value collected should be the last digit.

More difficult to implement part 2 when words to strings can appear.

- Check if number string, "one", "two", etc... exists within a string
- Check using a key following character located at i in string to j value
- Once you find and verify that the value does exist and create digit to add to stack
- perform same calculation as part 1
